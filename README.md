# Salary Calculator System

This is a Python-based console application that calculates an employee’s
monthly salary based on the number of working days.

- A 10% bonus for employees who worked 26 or more days
- A 10% deduction for employees who worked 20 or fewer days
- No change for employees who worked between 21 and 25 days

This project was developed to practice Python fundamentals such as:
- Variables and user input
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic operations

## Features
- Employee salary calculation
- Automatic bonus and deduction logic
- Clear and simple console output

## Technologies Used
